Best Practices for Java Spring Boot Service Layer Unit Tests

Use JUnit 5 and Mockito
Mock all dependencies
Test one method at a time
Cover both success and failure scenarios
Use @MockBean for Spring components
Test service methods in isolation
Arrange-Act-Assert pattern
Use meaningful test names
Verify mock interactions
Set up common test fixtures
Use @BeforeEach for test initialization
Don't test Spring framework itself
Avoid dependencies on application context
Keep tests fast and lightweight
Test exception handling
Use assertThrows for exceptions
Create separate test classes for each service
Mock external services and APIs
Use parameterized tests for multiple scenarios
Cover edge cases and boundary conditions
